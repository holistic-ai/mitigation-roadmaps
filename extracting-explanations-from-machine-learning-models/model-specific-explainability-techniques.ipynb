We will see here how to apply model-specific explainability techniques in a binary classification context. Let's imagine that a bank is trying to decide whether to give a mortgage to applicants. They use a machine learning algorithm to select viable candidates. The candidates are assigned either 0 if they are declined the mortgage or 1 if the mortgage is originated. \n","\n","\n","In this notebook, we will:\n","1. Load and organise the data \n","2.
