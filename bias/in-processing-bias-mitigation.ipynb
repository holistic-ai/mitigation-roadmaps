Let's imagine that a company is looking to hire a new employee. They use a machine learning algorithm to select the top candidates. The candidates are assigned either 0 if they are not selected or 1 if they are. \n","\n","In this notebook, we address bias by intervening at the in-processing stage. The Gradient Reduction approach (Agarwal et al 2018) makes use of constrained optimisation to reduce binary classification to a series of cost-sensitive, weighted classification problems. The optimal solution is then an equilibrium between two min max expressions. The steps we will take are outlined below.\n","\n","1. First, we will calculate fairness metrics for a base classifier\n","2. We will then apply the Reductions method to train a predictive model and observe the results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FaV6sRojLqem"},"source":["## **Install Libraries and load
