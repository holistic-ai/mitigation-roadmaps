Let's imagine that a company is looking to hire a new employee. They use a machine learning algorithm to select the top candidates. The candidates are assigned either 0 if they are not selected or 1 if they are. \n","\n","In this notebook, we will address unwanted bias by reweighing the dataset. Reweighing (Kamiran and Calders, 2012) is a pre-processing technique that amends the dataset to achieve statistical parity. The steps we will take are outlined below.\n","\n","1. First, we will calculate Disparate Impact and Statistical Parity Difference metrics for our training dataset\n","2. Before we start using a predictive model, we will use the Reweighing technique on the full dataset. This step should show that with the calculated weights assigned to the dataset, disparate impact and statistical parity difference are both removed. \n","3. We will then apply the Reweighing method to data used to train a predictive model and observe the results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FaV6sRojLqem"},"source":["## **Install Libraries
